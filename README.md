## An Investigation into Decreasing Bee Populations with Data Science

Since the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC’s) initial publication of disappearing bee colonies in 2006, public attention towards 
the dangers facing pollinators like honeybees has grown tremendously both on traditional and social media platforms. This trend has resulted in countless 
calls to action, requesting that people support local apiaries and keep pollinators in mind when applying pesticides or herbicides. 
They are not wrong about the danger, North America has 4 species of bumblebee in decline, and one that has gone extinct. 
Throughout all this media craze, though, it would seem that the general population learned little about the pollinators that they advocated 
for or how they could be helped.

This project serves two purposes: the first is to increase understanding of pollinators, specifically the Apis mellifera (or European/Western Honey Bee), 
the most commonly kept type of honeybee in North America. The second part of the project, motivated by the research in the first, will apply 
my Computer Science background to beekeeping in an investigation into how technology is, and could be used to protect beehives. 
It will explore commercially available beehive monitoring technology, existing beehive data metrics, and new ideas to discover what data is, 
and can be gathered from apiaries, and whether there is good reason to spend the money to do so.

# Progress
At the moment, the project has reached its' natural conclusion, due to the limitations imposed by the availability of beehive data sources. 
If you are interested in learning more about the Western Honey Bee and beehive monitoring systems, as well as seeing some of the work that was done to prepare
and visualize publically available beehive data, take a look at the video presentation or the PDF of the paper uploaded to this repository.

If you are interested in examining the data for yourself, the beecounted.ipynb and beehive-metrics_2017.ipynb files contain the data preparation and modeling
code produced in this project, or use the data found in the 'Beehive Metrics Dataset' or 'data' folders.
